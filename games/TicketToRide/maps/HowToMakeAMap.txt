A map is composed of three files:
- cities.csv
- tracks.csv
- objectives.csv


How to have a text map
a) put the list of (numberered) cities in cities.csv:
	number; city name
b) put the list of tracks in tracks.csv:
	`city1; city2; length; color1; color2`
	color2 is None if the track is not a double track
	color is Multicolor for "gray" tracks that can accept any color
c) draw it with a software like MonoDraw, export it (just for comparison)
d) add (manualy) in cities.csv the position of each city (line number, column number, and the number of characters, ususally 2, sometimes 3)
	`number; city; line; column; length`
e) add (manualy) in tracks.csv the path of each track
	`city1; city2; length; color1; color2; line; column; path`
	the path is a string composed of characters `N` (for North), `E` (for East), `S` (South) and `W` (West)
	A path `NNEENN` is a path that start from line;column, goes 2 times North, 2 times East and then 2 times North

For step d) and e) you can use testMap.py to compare the map you have exported from MonoDraw in 'map.txt' and the map built from cities.csv and tracks.csv
